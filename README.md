# Familytree

TLDR;
1. gem install ruby-familytree (if not available) unzip the files and then extract into your system and give 'bundle exec rake install:local'
2. start adding the commands via command line tool as given in the assessment.
3. There will be a file genearted to store the data in your local system, kindly ignore it.
4. Only few commands can be given now
5. Complex queries like grandparents / grandchild can't be retrived, i.e not more than 1 level can be achieved
